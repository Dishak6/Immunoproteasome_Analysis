# Immunoproteasome_Analysis
This repository consists of codes for LIANA, single-cell transcriptomics, and spatial transcriptomics analyses of different cancer datasets. 
The Analysis is done with respect to immunoproteasome expression in those datasets to understand the role of IP in tumour microenvironment evolution and cancer development.
